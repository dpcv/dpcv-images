These are pictures made by me of the printouts of the microfilm pictures of the 13th century Cullavagga Manuscript in the National Museum in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The pictures have not been enhanced but a with program like Irfanview they can easily be sharpened so that the letters are more clear. The contrast and brightness could also be improved. (Brightness only a bit more, 10%, and contrast can be 60% or more.)
